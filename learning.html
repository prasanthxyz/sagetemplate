                    <h2>Cathleen McCaffery:</h2>
                    <p>Cathleen is one the Founding Partners and Head of Academics at Sage, a comprehensive educational preparation and consulting company with expertise in admissions consulting, exam preparation, tutoring, and school research that works with students globally to help them gain admission to top schools.</p>

                    <p>As Head of the Admission Consulting program, Cathleen works with a select number of students to guide them through the university admission process. Cathleen has guided countless students through the undergraduate and graduate application process, and her students are now studying a range of fields from Engineering to Business and Chemistry at top universities globally such as NYU, Boston University, UCLA, Stanford, Northwestern, Columbia, and INSEAD.</p>

                    <p>Cathleen has also written course material for exam preparation courses, and worked with thousands of students globally from the US to the Middle East.</p>

                    <p>She possesses degrees in Literature from the University of Southern California and the New York University, and brings to the table her experience in mentoring thousands of students internationally and in the US for SAT, ACT, AP, IB, GRE, and GMAT exams in conjunction with skillfully consulting students for admission to globally reputed universities.</p>

                    <h2>SAT:</h2>
                    <h2 class="center">What is the SAT?</h2>
                    <p>Do you have that exceptional academic skill? Are you ready to cross borders for an extraordinary educational opportunity? Then the SAT is for you.</p>

                    <p>The Scholastic Aptitude Test lets you showcase your academic intelligence, opening admission opportunities at thousands of universities in the United States and American universities globally.</p>

                    <h2 class="center">What does the SAT test?</h2>
                    <p>The SAT assesses skills in Reading Comprehension, Grammar, Analytical Writing, and Math.</p>

                    <p>The SAT tests college readiness and proficiency along with key areas of Verbal and Math skills, but it is also a test of logic, and answers are designed to confused students. In order to do well on the SAT, it is essential to learn key strategies and techniques to essentially outsmart the test.</p>

                    <p>The exam is comprised of 3 tests -- Evidence-based reading and writing sections, Math sections, and an optional essay. The overall exam is 4 hours and 10 minutes and includes 3 short breaks.</p>

                    <p>Students can take the SAT a maximum of 5 times, with most students taking the exam 1-3 times. Score are valid for 5 years.</p>

                    <span class="center">How is SAT Preparation Helpful?</span>
                    <p>At Sage, we use a combination of real SAT test questions as well as exclusive, test prep material designed by American test preparation experts with over 25 years of experience in the field. Our exclusive math and verbal guidebooks synthesize the latest exam preparation techniques designed to help students increase efficiency, avoid test traps, and build critical thinking and analysis skills. With our handmade, thoughtful training and preparation, it is an easy test to crack.</p>

                    <span class="center">Mock Exams</span>
                    <p>All of our SAT mock tests are taken under real test conditions so that students gain an accurate sense of the difficulty level as well as time constraints of the exam.</p>

                    <h2 class="center">THE SAT OR ACT DILEMMA</h2>
                    <p>A question we often hear from students is, which test should I take? The answer is different for each student.</p>

                    <p>In 2016, the SAT was modified to better reflect what students are learning in school. Analogy questions that required memorizing hundreds of vocabulary words were removed, and the math tests increased in scope to include statistics and probability.</p>

                    <p>However, the new SAT verbal sections are reading intensive and do require thorough studying of vocabulary and content in order to perform well. The ACT reading section is less content intensive, but students have less time per question.</p>

                    <p>The quantitative sections on the SAT and ACT require an understating of a similar range of topics. Some crucial differences are that the ACT contains science and the questions tend to be more straightforward. The ACT tests students on their fundamental knowledge rather than their ability to perform well on exams.</p>

                    <p>The Writing and Language, or English ACT test renders more focus on grammar and logic and does not require students to study vocabulary as intensely as the SAT does.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the SAT essay evaluates students' rhetorical analysis skills, while the ACT essay tests critical thinking.</p>

                    <p>Which exam you decide is crucial, and Sage is here to guide you through the process. Your success is our success. Sage is here to help you to help you accomplish your goals and make sure that the profile you send to colleges highlights your most unique, and impressive qualities.</p>


                    <h2 class="center">WHAT is A GOOD SAT SCORE?</h2>
                    <p>There isn't a specific score that classifies as "GOOD." The score you need depends on universities you are applying to, their requirements, and your overall profile.</p>

                    <p>Universities consider your profile including grades, extracurricular activities, and any distinctive talents in order to determine acceptance. The SAT is not the only factor, but it is an important one. A high SAT score also makes students eligible for competitive scholarships.</p>

                    <p>The average score for the new SAT is 1000. That implies that, if you score above 1000 you are scoring higher than 50 percent of test takers. However, this also means that half of all test takers are scoring higher than you. At Sage, we help you determine your goal score and achieve it with customized individual and group courses targeted towards capitalizing every student's strengths and boosting each student's weaknesses.</p>


                    <h2 class="center">WHY SAGE?</h2>
                    <p>Sage makes the daunting task of applying to universities in the US and globally a surmountable one with customized SAT prep courses taught by American SAT experts to suit your individual needs. We provide both group and individual tutoring combined with a unique methodology and course material developed in the US by an expert panel of American educators.</p>

                    <p>Our trainers will identify your strengths and weaknesses to help you achieve the highest possible scores. Our team of trainers are responsive and talented and will help you conquer every hurdle in reaching your goals.</p>

                    <p>But it doesn’t stop there. We go far beyond just improving scores and grades.

We also inculcate time management, stress management, goal setting and key test-taking strategies into all of our courses.
